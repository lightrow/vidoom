Hand-crafted sprite work, curated selection of sfx, emphasis on good feels.

**Note**: There are two hud variants, one with scaled fonts and one with non-scaled. If the scaled variant doesn't look right on your monitor, try changing it to non-scaled in options ( set "Use old HUD" to off ), or play around with hud scaling options
